# Saving Manual Changes in a Container as a New Image

## Making Changes in a Container

Enter the container and create a directory there (using the `mkdir` command).

Then exit the container and save the changes as a new image.

Then add a tag to the image

### Useful Commands
Useful commands (**parameters can be checked in the documentation or in the console using the `-h` flag**):
- `docker ps`
- `docker exec` - the `it` flag is useful here - for interactive execution
- `docker commit`
- `docker images`
- `docker history`
- `docker stop CONTAINER_NAME`
- `docker rm CONTAINER_NAME`
- `docker tag`


## Additional Questions

Knowing the commands from this exercise look back at the previous and check:  
- What is the image history?
- What happened to the build image?
- What is the size difference between the build and run image?
