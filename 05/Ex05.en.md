# Write a docker-compose file that will contain the previously created `mydockerapp` service

Hints:
- Documentation: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)
- Indentation matters!
- Yaml supports comments (#) or `Crt+K`, `Crtl+C` (works in VS Code, but not in Visual Studio)
- Port mapping works as follows: `EXTERNAL_PORT:INTERNAL_PORT`
- The file should be named docker-compose.yml
- `services` - section for declaring services to be run.

Example file:

```yaml
version: "3.9" # version. Must be the first line
services: # One of the first level objects in yaml docker-compose. Specifies services that will be run
  redis: # service name (equivalent to --name)
    image: redis:alpine # image
    ports: # ports
      - "6379:6379" # notice how ports are declared. This is how lists are defined
```

Docker compose commands:
- `docker-compose up` - starts the environment.
  
# Building an image using docker-compose

Goal: Add appropriate sections to the `docker-compose` file to enable building images using the `docker-compose build` command

Hints:
- Documentation for the build section: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#build](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#build)

Docker compose commands:
- `docker-compose up` - starts the environment. Without building!
- `docker-compose build` - when executed in the directory with the `docker-compose.yaml` file, builds the services.
- `docker-compose up --build` - builds and runs the services.
  
# Running 2 instances of `mydockerapp`

By changing the `docker-compose` file, run two instances of `mydockerapp`

# Reducing code repetition

Yaml enables inheritance. To achieve this, use the following syntax in the yaml file:
- `SOMETHING: &XXX` - naming a section (everything from this indentation level down) that will be reused
- `SOMETHING_SIMILAR:<<: *XXX` - declaration that `SOMETHING_SIMILAR` inherits from `SOMETHING`

# Environment variables

Replace the command `docker run --env VAR1=value1 --env VAR2=value2 ubuntu env | grep VAR` with declarations in `docker-compose`

Hints:
- commands in `docker-compose` are passed using the [`command`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/docker/tutorials/use-docker-compose#define-the-app-service) object in the `docker-compose` file
- environment variables are passed using the `environment` object

# Reading environment variables from a file

Docker-compose supports reading environment variables from a file.

Task:
Move environment variables to a separate file.

Hints:
- a file named `.env` will be automatically read by `docker-compose`
