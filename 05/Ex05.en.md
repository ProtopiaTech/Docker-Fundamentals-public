# **Docker Image Scanning Exercise**

## **Objective**
Learn how to **scan a Docker image for vulnerabilities** using **Trivy** in a Linux environment.

---

## **🚀 Step 1: Install Required Tools**

### **🔹 Install Trivy**  
Ensure you have **Trivy** installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy

```

Verify installation:
```bash
trivy --version
```

If Trivy is unavailable, run it using Docker:
```bash
docker run --rm aquasec/trivy --version
```

---

## **🛠 Step 2: Pull a Vulnerable Docker Image**
We’ll use a known **vulnerable image** for testing:

```bash
docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa
```

Verify the image:
```bash
docker images | grep dvwa
```

---

## **🔍 Step 3: Scan the Image for Vulnerabilities**

### **Using Trivy**
Run a vulnerability scan on the image:

```bash
trivy image vulnerables/web-dvwa
```

👉 **Expected Output:** You’ll see a list of found **CVE vulnerabilities**, their **severity**, and affected **packages**.


### Filter the output

```bash
trivy image --severity CRITICAL vulnerables/web-dvwa
```

1. Identify critical vulnerabilities and note the affected packages.
2. Look up the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in an online database like [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/).
3. Determine if there is a patched version of the package available.

---

## **✅ Step 4: Fix Vulnerabilities (Best Practices)**
1. **Use a smaller base image**  
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine  # Instead of node:18
   ```
2. **Update dependencies regularly**  
   ```bash
   apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
   ```
3. **Use multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface**
   1. Verify the number of vulnerabilities for .net sdk and .net runtime images.
4. **Scan regularly and integrate into CI/CD pipelines**

---

## **🎯 Exercise Tasks**
1. **Run the Trivy scan** on another image (e.g., `nginx:latest`).  
   ```bash
   trivy image nginx:latest
   ```
2. **Fix vulnerabilities** by switching to a minimal base image.
3. **Automate scanning in a script and run it on multiple images.**

---

## **🔚 Conclusion**
Regular **Docker image scanning** is crucial for security. Always update dependencies, choose **lightweight base images**, and integrate scanning into **CI/CD workflows**.
