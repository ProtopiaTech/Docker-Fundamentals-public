# Networks
## List networks

```shell
docker network ls
```

## Bridge network

```shell
docker run -it -d --name c1 alpine ash
docker run -it -d --name c2 alpine ash

# check ips
docker exec -it c1 sh -c "ip a"
docker exec -it c2 sh -c "ip a"
```

```shell
# Attach to c1 and ping c2
docker exec -it c1 sh
ping –c 2 <C2 IP>
```

```shell
# Attach to c2 and ping c1
docker exec -it c2 sh
ping –c 2 <C1 IP>
```

```shell
docker network inspect bridge
```

### Cleanup

```shell
# --force will stop the container if it is running
docker rm --force c1
docker rm --force c2
```

## User-defined

```shell
docker network create --driver bridge my_net
# verify if the network was created
docker network ls
# Run within network
docker run -it -d --name a1 --network my_net alpine ash
docker run -it -d --name a2 --network my_net alpine ash
```

```shell
# the containers won't be in the bridge network
docker network inspect bridge

# they will be in the `my_net`
docker network inspect my_net
```

### Connect a container to a network

```shell
# Create a container that is not in the `my_net` network
docker run -it -d --name a3 alpine ash

# Verify
docker network inspect my_net

# Connect a3 to `my_net`
docker network connect my_net a3

# Verify that it is in the `my_net` network
docker network inspect my_net

# It is also in the `bridge` network
docker network inspect bridge
```

### Service discovery

In user defined networks we have name resolution. So we can call containers based on their name not only IP

```shell
docker exec -it a1 sh
ping -c 2 a2
```
